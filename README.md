# Peshitta Transmuter

## Background
Some people a long time ago translated the Bible to Syriac, this translation is called Peshitta. Read about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshitta).

Biblical scholars like translations because they shed light on the translator's interpretation of the text.

Syriac is a dialect of Aramaic. Aramaic and Hebrew share an alphabet, but with different scripts. Many Jewish religious works are written in Aramaic so it is familiar to many Jewish scholars, however these works are written almost always in a Hebrew script. So the Aramiac script is foreign to most Jewish scholars.

## Task
The [Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon Project](http://cal.huc.edu/) (CAL) of [Hebrew Union College](http://www.huc.edu/) has a version of the Peshitta in the Syriac script online. A friend of mine asked me to produce a version in the Hebrew script.
